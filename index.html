            <h3>About me</h3>
            <P>ðŸ‘‹Â Hi, Iâ€™m Oyindamola, a Product Designer and aspiring software Developer. My journey into tech began
                with
                a deep curiosity about how software can solve real-world problems. This curiosity led me to pursue a
                career in product design, where I spent almost two years creating thoughtful and impactful designs.Over
                time, I
                realized I
                wanted to do more than just designâ€”I wanted to bring those designs to life. This passion led me to
                explore software engineering, and Iâ€™m now studying at Altschool's School of Engineering (Student ID:
                ALT/SOE/024/0537), where Iâ€™m learning to turn ideas into reality through code..</P>
            <h4>What i do?</h4>
            <p>Product Strategy, UI/UX design, UX Research, UX Writing</p>

            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <P>I am a South-pawed creative at heart with a lifelong love for drawing, storytelling, and design.As a
                teenager, I spent my days lost in drawing and crafting storybooks,
                letting my imagination take the lead.This early passion naturally guided me to study Industrial Design
                at university. <br>
                After graduating, I transitioned into Product Design, where I spent two years crafting user-centered
                digital experiences.Driven by a desire to bring my designs to life, Iâ€™ve now ventured into software
                engineering at
                Altschool's School of Engineering <br>

                When Iâ€™m not deep in design or learning coding, youâ€™ll find me sketching out new ideas, writing stories,
                or writing poemsâ€”some of which you can find on my <b>About Me page</b>.

            </P>
            <h4>Why i joined alt school?</h4>
            <p>I joined the Alt School of Engineering to deepen my technical skills and broaden my understanding of
                engineering principles. My background in product design has given me a solid foundation in user
                experience
                and design thinking, but I wanted to integrate these skills with a strong technical background. Alt
                School
                of Engineering offers an innovative approach to learning that aligns perfectly with my goal of merging
                design and engineering to create impactful, user-centered solutions.
